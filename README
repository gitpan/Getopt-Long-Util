NAME
    Getopt::Long::Util - Utilities for Getopt::Long

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.79 of Getopt::Long::Util (from Perl
    distribution Getopt-Long-Util), released on 2014-12-21.

FUNCTIONS
  parse_getopt_long_opt_spec($str) => hash
    Parse Getopt::Long option specification. Will produce a hash with some
    keys: "opts" (array of option names, in the order specified in the opt
    spec), "type" (string, type name), "desttype" (either '', or '@' or
    '%'), "is_neg" (true for "--opt!"), "is_inc" (true for "--opt+"),
    "min_vals" (int, usually 0 or 1), "max_vals" (int, usually 0 or 1 except
    for option that requires multiple values),

    Will return undef if it can't parse $str.

    Examples:

     $res = parse_getopt_long_opt_spec('help|h|?'); # {opts=>['help', 'h', '?'], type=>undef}
     $res = parse_getopt_long_opt_spec('--foo=s');  # {opts=>['foo'], type=>'s', min_vals=>1, max_vals=>1}

  humanize_getopt_long_opt_spec($str) => str
    Convert Getopt::Long option specification like "help|h|?" or <--foo=s>
    or "debug!" into, respectively, "--help, -h, -?" or "--foo=s" or
    "--(no)debug". Will die if can't parse $str. The output is suitable for
    including in help/usage text.

  detect_getopt_long_script(%args) => envres
  detect_getopt_long_script(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    Detect whether a file is a Getopt::Long-based CLI script.

    The criteria are:

    *   the file must exist and readable;

    *   (optional, if "include_noexec" is false) file must have its
        executable mode bit set;

    *   content must start with a shebang "#!";

    *   either: must be perl script (shebang line contains 'perl') and must
        contain something like "use Getopt::Long";

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   filename => *str*

        Path to file to be checked.

        Either "filename" or "string" must be specified.

    *   include_noexec => *bool* (default: 1)

        Include scripts that do not have +x mode bit set.

    *   string => *buf*

        Path to file to be checked.

        Either "file" or "string" must be specified.

    Return value:

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

     (any)

SEE ALSO
    Getopt::Long

    Getopt::Long::Spec, which can also parse Getopt::Long spec into hash as
    well as transform back the hash to Getopt::Long spec. OO interface. I
    should've found this module first before writing my own
    "parse_getopt_long_opt_spec()". But at least currently
    "parse_getopt_long_opt_spec()" is at least about 30-100+% faster than
    Getopt::Long::Spec::Parser, has a much simpler implementation (a single
    regex match), and can handle valid Getopt::Long specs that
    Getopt::Long::Spec::Parser fails to parse, e.g. "foo|f=s@".
